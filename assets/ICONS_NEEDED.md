# Icons Needed

The extension requires PNG icons at the following sizes:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

## Temporary Solution

For development, you can:

1. Use the `icon.svg` file as a template
2. Convert it to PNG using an online tool like:
   - https://cloudconvert.com/svg-to-png
   - https://ezgif.com/svg-to-png
3. Save the converted files as icon16.png, icon48.png, icon128.png

## Alternative: Use Placeholder

Or temporarily comment out the "icons" section in manifest.json during development.

## Design Notes

The icon should represent:
- Navigation/organization (geometric shapes)
- Chat/conversation (bubble or lines)
- Clean, minimal aesthetic
- Works well at small sizes (16px)
